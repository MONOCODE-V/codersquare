Codersquare
Last updated: September 7, 2025

Codersquare is a social web application for sharing and discovering learning resources in a Hacker News-style format. The platform is designed to be a collaborative space where developers can share articles, tutorials, and other educational content.

I'm building this project publicly, and I welcome contributions from the community. If you're interested in helping out, feel free to send a pull request or open an issue.

Tech Stack
This project is built with TypeScript and JavaScript.

Back-end: Express.js for the server, with express-async-handler for simplified error handling.

Database: SQLite for data persistence, managed with the sqlite and sqlite3 npm packages.

Development Tools: We use nodemon to automatically restart the server during development and ts-node to execute TypeScript code directly.

Front-end: Coming soon - a modern web application built with React.

Getting Started
To get a copy of this project up and running on your local machine, follow these simple steps.

Prerequisites
You'll need to have Node.js and npm installed.

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone [https://github.com/MONOCODE-V/codersquare](https://github.com/MONOCODE-V/codersquare)


Navigate to the project root directory:

cd codersquare


Install back-end dependencies:

cd server
npm install


Start the server:

npm start


This command executes "nodemon --exec \"node --loader ts-node/esm\" index.ts", which uses nodemon and ts-node to run the TypeScript server, automatically restarting it when you make changes to the code.

The server should now be running locally. You can access the application by opening your web browser.

Key Features
Authentication
The platform will include a robust authentication system to manage user accounts. This will allow users to:

Sign up and create an account.

Log in and log out securely.

Manage their profile and settings.

Monetization and Community Platform (MCP)
The project will also include an MCP, which is a system for a future community token and gamification. This feature will aim to:

Reward users for valuable contributions and engagement.

Foster a positive and active community through a point-based system.

Provide a foundation for future monetization models.

Architecture
This project is planned with a microservices architecture to ensure scalability and maintainability as it grows. The application will be composed of a set of loosely coupled, independently deployable services. Key design patterns and principles will include:

Service Discovery: Services will be able to find and communicate with each other dynamically.

API Gateway: A single entry point will manage requests and route them to the appropriate services.

Event-Driven Communication: Services will communicate asynchronously via events to reduce dependencies.

Documentation
